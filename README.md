A remake of [Station-8](https://klehrik.itch.io/station-8), which I created over 3 years prior.  
It was meant to fix a lot of the gripes I had with the original, as well as expand more on the progression to push it towards being more of an actual metroidvania.

Most of the game is actually done (with 3 bosses out of 4 bosses complete), however after wrestling with the cart limitations for so long I finally hit a brick wall in terms of character compression; I had decided to use pancelor's [bigmap](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=46225) in order to double the maximum map size of PICO-8, and I didn't really feel like rewriting a lot to accomodate another solution, hence the shelving of this project.
