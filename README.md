![Showcase of Station-8 Remake](https://github.com/Klehrik/Station-8-Remake/assets/78520710/18f816a1-25b6-4bb9-b2bd-3af2b4b0b0d4)


A remake of [Station-8](https://klehrik.itch.io/station-8), which I created over 3 years prior.  
It was meant to fix a lot of the gripes I had with the original, as well as expand more on the progression to push it towards being more of an actual metroidvania.

Most of the game is actually done (with 3 bosses out of 4 bosses complete), however after wrestling with the cart limitations for so long (with *two* major rewrites) I finally hit a brick wall in terms of compression (which as I found out too late, was *way* over); I had decided to use pancelor's [bigmap](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=46225) from the beginning in order to double the maximum map size of PICO-8, and I didn't really feel like rewriting a lot to accomodate another solution, hence the shelving of this project.  
I also experimented with a component system in order to reuse code a lot more and allow me the ability to have objects only inherit bits of code they actually needed.

I can't actually build the binaries for this since the compression is at 20150 (out of 15616), so it is only playable by downloading the source and running it from a PICO-8 console.

EDIT Jan 28: Currently in the middle of restarting this in Godot.
